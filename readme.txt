Make your blocks look like photocopies.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a block style called \"Photocopy\" to the Image, Gallery, and Media & Text blocks. When applied, it roughly emulates the look of a high-contrast photocopy. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the \"Plugins\" screen in WordPress
3. Select an Image, Gallery, or Media & Text block. 
4. Using either the block switcher or the block settings, choose the \"Photocopy\" block style. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

The block style applies a handful of CSS filters to your images. It looks kind of like a photocopy. 

= Any caveats I should know about? =

It doesn't play great with Image block captions at the moment. The the overlay pattern sometimes shows up behind it.
